## Objective

One of the fundamentals of ReactJS is the concept of composability and reusability through creating custom components. This has allowed us to move on from hundreds to thousands of lines of code in vanilla JavaScript to a more efficient framework. This is an Airbnb Experiences clone with three main components, the navbar component, the hero component, and the card components. My goal for working on this project was to practice components and add attributes to them through props, which allowed me to mimic receiving data from an API to populate the data, such as the image displayed, the rating of the service, which country the service is located, and the price of the service. Furthermore, I implemented JavaScript to conditionally render a "Sold Out" or "Online" badge depending on the information received by props.

Lastly, I also implemented Flexbox CSS to make the design as responsive and as appealing as it could be. This app is intended to be a mobile application, so it is not optimized for desktop view.
